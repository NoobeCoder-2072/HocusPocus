# HocusPocus
This Python script calculates various properties of an electron transitioning between different energy levels, based on the Bohr model. Given two orbit numbers (n1 and n2), the program computes the electron's wavelength, frequency, color/type, energy, velocity, and relativistic mass. It includes specific series classifications (e.g., Lyman, Balmer) and estimates the visible color based on the wavelength range.

Key Features:
Calculates the electron's wavelength for specified orbits.
Determines the wavelength's corresponding electromagnetic series and visible color.
Computes related properties: frequency, energy in eV, velocity, and relativistic mass.
Designed to help learners understand electron transitions and properties in atomic physics.
